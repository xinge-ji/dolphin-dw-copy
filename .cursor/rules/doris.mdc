# Apache Doris rules

- Use appropriate data types to optimize storage and performance (e.g., BIGINT for IDs, TINYINT for is_*)
- Create indexes for columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses
- Avoid using SELECT * and only retrieve needed columns
- Use appropriate character set and collation (e.g., utf8mb4_unicode_ci)
